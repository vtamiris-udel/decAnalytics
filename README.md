A course focused on making intelligent, explainable, and understandable decisions when using analytics and avoiding common pitfalls in data modeling.

## Course Overview

<table>
<tr>
<td width="70%">
This course teaches students to build bulletproof decision analytics by systematically avoiding the analytical traps that lead others into quicksand. Following Charlie Munger's principle that "trying to be consistently not stupid" creates more value than chasing analytical brilliance, students develop AI-powered practical skills in interpretable data modeling through hands-on challenges and engaged lectures.
