# 🚀 Tech Setup Challenge - Quick Start Guide

## Challenge Overview

This challenge will get you set up with many of the essential tools for BUAD 442. You'll learn to use modern development tools that are standard in the analytics industry.

## Part 1: Core Tools Setup ⚙️

### 1. 📝 Cursor AI Setup

- Go to [cursor.com/students](https://cursor.com/students)
- Sign up with your **udel.edu email** (free for students for 1-year! 🎓, but may need credit card)
  - **Backup plan:** If student account approval is delayed or has issues, you can sign up for a free 2-week trial at [cursor.com](https://cursor.com) while waiting for your student account to be approved
- Download and install Cursor AI (default choices for installation are fine)
- Launch Cursor AI

### 1.5. 🎛️ Cursor AI Interface & Git Setup

**Getting Familiar with Cursor AI:** Challenge yourself to explore the menus and use documentation to find the below items. ([https://docs.cursor.com/en/welcome](https://docs.cursor.com/en/welcome))

- **Activity Bar** (left side): Contains icons for different features
  - Explorer (files)
  - Search
  - Source Control (Git)
  - Agents
  - 📦 Extensions
- **Sidebar** (right of activity bar): Shows content for the selected activity

**💾 Saving Files in Cursor AI:**

- **Auto-save:** Cursor AI automatically saves files to memory as you type (you'll see a small dot on the file tab when there are unsaved changes)
  - **Note:** Auto-save is convenient but doesn't guarantee your work is written to disk
- **Manual save:** Press `Ctrl+S` to save the current file to disk
  - **Important:** This ensures your work is permanently stored and visible to Git
- **Save all:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` to save all open files to disk
- **File indicators:** 
  - White dot on tab = unsaved changes
  - No dot = file is saved
  - Always manually save before closing files, switching tasks, or committing to Git!

**AI Interaction in Cursor:**

- **Quick Chat (Ask Mode):** Press `Ctrl+L` to open a quick chat with AI
  - Perfect for asking questions about your code
  - Gets context from your current file
  - Great for debugging, explaining code, or getting suggestions
- **Agent Mode:** Click the **Agents icon** in the activity bar
  - More powerful AI assistant that can work across your entire project
  - Can analyze multiple files, suggest refactoring, and help with complex tasks
  - **Difference:** Ask mode is for quick questions, Agent mode is for deeper project-wide assistance

**Set up Git for Local Source Control:**

- Click the **Source Control icon** (three-branch icon) in the activity bar
- Follow prompts to Download Git (use default settings when prompted)
  - **Why?** Git tracks all changes to your files, so you can see what you've modified
- **Return to Cursor** after Git installation completes
- This sets up Git tracking (version control) for your local project folder
  - **Why?** Version control lets you save your work progress and collaborate with others
- Later in this tutorial, you will see a "Changes" section in the sidebar showing modified files
  - **Why?** This helps you see exactly what files you've changed before submitting
- **Alternative:** You can also click "Clone Repository" in the Source Control panel to get your GitHub repository

### 2. 🔗 GitHub Account

- Create account at [github.com](https://github.com) (if you don't have one)
- Not necessarily needed, but use your **udel.edu email** for consistency/simplicity

### 3. 📥 Get Course Materials

**Option A - Fork & Clone (Recommended):**

- Go to [course repo: https://github.com/flyaflya/buad442Fall2025](https://github.com/flyaflya/buad442Fall2025) on GitHub ( make sure you are logged in to GitHub, otherwise you won't see the Fork button)
- Click the **"Fork"** button (top right) to create your own copy
  - **Why?** Forking creates your own copy on GitHub where you can make changes without messing up Adam's GitHub repository
  - **Why?** You can't directly edit the original course repository
- Now, get a copy of your GitHub repository locally so you can edit with Cursor AI. In Cursor AI, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Git: Clone"
- Paste your forked repo URL: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/buad442Fall2025`
  - **Why?** This downloads your personal copy to your computer
- Choose where to save locally (I recommend somewhere easy to find like C:\).  A folder named `buad442Fall2025` will be placed in this location for you upon cloning.

### 4. 👤 Create Your Student Folder

**Using the Activity Bar & Sidebar:**

- Click the **Explorer icon** (looks like stacked files) in the activity bar to open the file explorer
- In the sidebar, you'll see your project files
- Navigate to `student-portfolios/AdamF`
  - **Tip:** Click the small arrows (>) next to folder names to expand them
- **Right-click** in the `student-portfolios` folder → "New Folder"
- Name your folder: `YourNickNameLastInitial` (e.g., `JohnD`, `SivaX`, etc.)
  - **FERPA Privacy Option:** If you prefer not to use your real name, you can use a pseudonym like `Student001`, `Analyst2025`, or `DataLearner` instead.  Just email Adam (ajf@udel.edu) and he'll note the connection.
- **Right-click** on `AdamF/README.md` → "Copy" (this will be your template to modify for your submission)
- **Right-click** in your new nickname folder → "Paste" (this is the file you will modify for your submission)
- **Double-click** the copied `README.md` (i.e. the one in your newly created nickname folder) to open and edit it
- Edit `README.md` with your info and add two cool pictures of you and/or your interests
  - **Important:** Save the image files in your student folder (e.g., `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.png`)
  - **Why?** The images need to be in your folder to be included in your GitHub submission
  - **Note:** These will be public images, so choose appropriate photos
- **💾 Save your work:** Press `Ctrl+S` to save the file after making your edits
- **🔄 Commit your progress:** After saving, commit your changes to protect your work:
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+G` to open Source Control
  - Click the "+" next to your modified files to stage them
  - Write a commit message like "Add personal info to my README.md"
  - Click "Commit" (✓ icon)
  - **Why commit now?** This creates a backup of your work in case something goes wrong!

### 4.5. 🔄 Sync to GitHub & Verify Content

**Before submitting your pull request, let's make sure everything is properly uploaded and visible on GitHub:**

- **💾 Save all files first:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` to save all your work
- **Push to GitHub:** In Cursor AI, click "Sync Changes" or "Push" to upload your changes
  - **Why?** This uploads your local changes to your GitHub fork
- **Verify on GitHub:** Go to your forked repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/buad442Fall2025`
- **Check your student folder:** Navigate to `student-portfolios/[YourNickNameLastInitial]/` on GitHub
- **Verify your content:**
  - [ ] Your `README.md` file is visible and contains your personal information
  - [ ] Your photos are properly displayed in the README.md file
  - [ ] All image files are uploaded to your student folder
  - [ ] No broken image links or missing content
- **If anything is missing or incorrect:**
  - Go back to Cursor AI and make the necessary changes
  - Save, commit, and push again
  - Refresh your GitHub page to verify the updates
- **Only proceed to the next step when everything looks correct on GitHub!**

### 5. 🔄 Submit via Pull Request

**What is a Pull Request?**
A pull request is like asking "Hey, can you add my changes to your project?" It's how you submit your work for review and inclusion in the main course repository. Think of it as a digital way to turn in your homework!

**Since you already synced your changes to GitHub in step 4.5, you can now create your pull request directly:**

- Go to your forked repo on GitHub to create the pull request

**Create Pull Request:**

- Go to your forked repo: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/buad442Fall2025`
- You should see a banner saying "This branch is X commits ahead of flyaflya:main"
  - **Why?** This shows your fork has changes that aren't in the original course repo
- Click **"Compare & pull request"**
  - **Why?** This requests to merge your changes into the original course repository
- Add description: "Student submission for [YourName]"
  - **Why?** This helps identify your submission and explains what you did
- Click **"Create pull request"**
  - **Why?** This submits your work for review and inclusion in the course materials

## Part 2: Quarto Setup 📊

### Why Quarto?

Quarto is essential for creating **professional reports** that combine:

- **Text** (like this document)
- **Code** (Python/R analysis)
- **Visualizations** (charts, graphs)
- **Interactive elements** (dashboards)

It's not just for code - it's for creating beautiful, reproducible documents that are perfect for business presentations and reports.

### 6. 📚 Install Quarto

- Go to [quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- Download and install Quarto for your operating system
- Verify installation: Open terminal/command prompt and type `quarto --version`

- **💡 Recommended:** Install the Quarto extension in Cursor AI for better editing experience:
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open Extensions (from with Cursor AI)
  - Search for "Quarto"
  - Install the "Quarto" extension by Quarto
  - **Why?** This gives you syntax highlighting, live preview, and better editing support for `.qmd` files

### 7.  Test Quarto

Create a simple test document:

1. Create a new file in your student portfolios folder called `test.qmd`
2. Add this content (replace bracketed text with your nickname):
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "My First Quarto Document"
   format: html
   ---
   
   # Hello World! 👋
   
   This is my first Quarto document. My nick name is [YourNickNameLastInitial].
   ```
3. **💾 Save the file:** Press `Ctrl+S` to save your new `test.qmd` file

4. **🤖 Experience Cursor AI Magic:** Let's add some content about your interests using Cursor's AI assistant:
   - **Open the AI Chat:** Press `Ctrl+L` to open Cursor's AI chat panel (or click the chat icon in the sidebar)
   - **Ensure correct context:** Make sure your `test.qmd` file is open and active in the editor (click on it if needed)
     - **Why?** This ensures Cursor AI has the correct file context for the conversation
   - **Check the mode:** In the chat panel, make sure the dropdown shows "Ask" (not "Agent")
     - **Why?** "Ask" mode is perfect for quick content additions to your current file
   - **Ask Cursor to add content:** Type something like: "Add a paragraph about my interest in [your hobby/sport/music/etc] to this document"
   - **Example prompts you can try:**
     - "Add a paragraph about my love for basketball and how I play point guard"
     - "Add a section about my passion for photography and the types of photos I like to take"
     - "Add content about my interest in cooking and my favorite recipes"
   - **Cursor will add the content directly to your file!** You can edit it if needed
   - **💡 Pro Tip:** This demonstrates how Cursor AI can quickly generate content and help you write faster!

5. **🔄 Quick commit:** After adding content with AI, commit your enhanced file:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+G` → click "+" next to `test.qmd`
   - Write commit message: "Add test Quarto document with AI-generated content"
   - Click "Commit" (✓ icon)

6. Render it using the terminal/command prompt:
   **Opening Terminal in Cursor AI:**
   - Press `Ctrl + `` (backtick key, usually under the Esc key) to open the integrated terminal
   - OR go to the top menu: **Terminal** → **New Terminal**
   - OR press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → type "Terminal: Create New Terminal" → press Enter
   
   **Navigating to Your File:**
   - The terminal opens in your project root folder, but you need to be in your student folder
   - Navigate to your student folder: `cd "C:\buad442Fall2025\challenges\01-Tech-Setup-Challenge\student-submissions\YourNickNameLastInitial"`
   - Replace `YourNickNameLastInitial` with your actual folder name
   - **💡 Pro Tip:** Press the `Tab` key while typing to auto-complete folder names! This saves time and prevents typos.
   
   **Alternative (if you installed the Quarto extension):**
   - Open your `test.qmd` file in Cursor AI
   - Look for the **"Preview"** button in the top-right corner of the editor
   - Click it to render and view your document without using the terminal!
   
   **Running the Render Command:**
   - Type: From the directory with `test.qmd`, use the terminal to type `quarto render test.qmd` and press Enter
   - You should see output indicating the file was rendered successfully
   - This will create a `test.html` file in the same folder
   - **💾 Commit the generated HTML:** After successful rendering, commit the new `test.html` file:
     - Press `Ctrl+Shift+G` → click "+" next to `test.html`
     - Write commit message: "Add rendered Quarto HTML output"
     - Click "Commit" (✓ icon)
   
   **Alternative Method (if terminal seems complicated):**
   - Right-click on `test.qmd` in the file explorer
   - Look for "Open in Terminal" or "Open in Command Prompt" option
   - Then type: `quarto render test.qmd`
7. Open the generated `test.html` file
8. **🔄 Final commit before submission:** 

   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` to save all files
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+G` → stage any remaining changes
   - Write commit message: "Complete Quarto setup and testing"
   - Click "Commit" (✓ icon)
   - **Why?** This ensures all your work is safely backed up before the final submission!

### 8. 🔄 Update Your Pull Request

**Your pull request will update with new commits!** Here's how:

- **Push your new commits:** In Cursor AI, click "Sync Changes" or "Push" to upload your Quarto work
- **Check your pull request:** Go back to your GitHub pull request page
- **You'll see:** The pull request now includes both your initial submission AND your Quarto testing
- **The pull request updates automatically** because it's tracking your branch, not specific commits

**What you should see:**

- Your original pull request now shows all your commits in the "Commits" tab
- The "Files changed" tab will show both your `submission.md` and `test.qmd`/`test.html` files
- Everything is in one place for easy review

**💡 Pro Tip:** This is how real development works - you keep adding commits to your branch, and the pull request shows all changes on that branch!

## 🔄 Keeping Your Fork Updated (Getting Course Updates)

**Why you need this:** When I add new course materials, challenges, or updates, your fork won't automatically get them. You'll need to sync manually.

**Easy Method (GitHub Web Interface):**

1. Go to your forked repo: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/buad442Fall2025`
2. Look for a **"Sync fork"** banner at the top (appears when there are updates)
3. Click **"Update branch"** to pull in the latest changes
4. In Cursor AI: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Git: Pull" to download changes to your computer

**What this does:**

- **Syncs your GitHub fork** with my original repository
- **Downloads updates** to your local computer
- **Keeps you current** with new course materials and challenges

**💡 Pro Tip:** Check for the "Sync fork" banner whenever you start working on new course materials. This ensures you're working with the latest version!
